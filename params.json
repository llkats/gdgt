The tools used were Coda, Chrome, LiveReload, DigitalColor Meter and Git. It is meant to fulfill the following specification:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t## Objective\r\n\t\tUsing HTML5, CSS, Javascript:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t* Build a single page with a div that is horizontally- and vertically-centered.\r\n\t\t* The div should have three tabs inside of it with only one tab selected at any given time.\r\n\t\t* The selected/activated tab should have a different color or size so it stands out.\r\n\t\t* Content should flow responsively if the viewport is resized.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t## Features\r\n\t\t* Clicking from one tab to another should update the URL to include either a path (ex. \"/tab2/\") or hash (ex. \"#tab2\") for the newly selected tab, without a page reload.\r\n\t\t* Clicking from one tab to another and then using the browser's Back or Forward function should switch to the formerly selected tab, and update the URL with its corresponding path or hash (without a page reload).\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t## Guidelines/Limitations\r\n\t\t* Markup should adhere to HTML5 doctype.\r\n\t\t* Use raw Javascript without the use of a framework.\r\n\t\t* Styles are up to you: nothing fancy required, but bonus points for aesthetics and use of advanced CSS3 features.\r\n\t\t* Don't worry about degrading gracefully for users without Javascript.\r\n\t\t\r\nThanks for looking!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
